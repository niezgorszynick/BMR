# BMR
This is my second program in Python.

I came up for the idea while reading a gym leaflet (nobody cares, I know).

It is quite simple: based on the given formula it calculates the suggested calory intake.
The formula is: BMR = 66 + (13,7 × weight in kg) + (5 × height in cm) - (6,8 × age in years)

In current version it only supports calculations for males - I plan to extend its functionality into females as well.

It's a bit rough on the edges but I use it to test my skills and improve them overtime.
